)->register();



// This option (using registerDirs) is not recommended in terms of performance, since Phalcon will need to perform a significant number of file stats on each folder, looking for the file with the same name as the class. Itâ€™s important to register the directories in relevance order. Remember always add a trailing slash at the end of the paths.
